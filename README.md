# CS230-Software-Design-Template

* **Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**

  The Gaming Room is a game creator that wanted to expand their mobile game app Draw It or Lose It by developing a web-based version.
* **What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**
  
  I think, considering my, objectively very limited practical knowledge, the Recommendations section was detailed and reasonable. I put a lot of thought into the platform recomendation and every other decision that came out of it.
* **What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**

  Domain model in form of URL diagram was very helpful, because it is much easier to shuffle squares on the diagram and then develop code, than rewriting the code every time you find some inefficiency. It was the planning step that has potentially saved hours of work.
* **If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

  I would review the Evaluation and Recommendations sections to dive deeper into the topic and provide the client and development team with more details.
* **How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

  Ultimately, the application is developed for the user. If they don't like it, don't find it intuitive, fast, or stable enough, they won't use it. After analysing the user's needs, I recommended the environment setup that, in my opinion, suited those needs in the best way.
* **How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**

  I think it is important to keep the big picture in mind when starting to design software. It is easy to zero in on a specific issue, but that wastes at early stages, and the solution might clash with other pieces, or not fit in at all. Just like in art, we start with a sketch and then build on it by adding details.
